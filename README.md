Prototype for Vue.js-style components for PHP

## Rationale

There's far too much Javascript on the web these days requiring multi-megabyte bundles
that can become far too cumbersome to develop, and are heavy on the users' web browsers.
There are, however, some niceties from frontend tooling such as componentized templates.
This project aims to bring these to PHP so that you can have a familiar, quick development
experience with server-side rendered pages.
